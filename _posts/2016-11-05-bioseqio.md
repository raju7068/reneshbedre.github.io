The Biopython SeqIO module involves manipulating various formats of biological data files. Here, we cover the SeqIO module utilities in handling biological data files efficiently.

Note: To use biopython, you need to install it. [how to install biopython](http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/install/Installation.html)

Fasta files:

```python
# import modules
from Bio import SeqIO
import sys

# read file as arguement on command line
fasta_file = open(sys.argv[1], "rU")

#parse the open file handle with SeqIO.parse
for record in SeqIO.parse(fasta_file, "fasta"):
    # sequence id
    seq_id = record.id
    # sequence
    seq_seq = record.seq
    # sequence length
    seq_len = len(seq_seq) # or len(record)
    # detail record: ID, Name, Description, Feature and sequence object
    detail_rec = record
    # reverse complement
    seq_rc = seq_seq.reverse_complement()
    # get sub sequence seq[start:end]
    seq_subseq = seq_seq[0:100] # extract first 100 bp
    # get mRNA (messenger RNA)
    mrna_seq = seq_seq.transcribe()
    # from mRNA to back to coding strand of the DNA after transcription
    dna_seq = mrna_seq.back_transcribe()
    # coding DNA strand translation into proteins
    prot_seq = seq_seq.translate()
```
