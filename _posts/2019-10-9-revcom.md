**<span style="color:#33a8ff">What is Reverse complementary?</span>**
- In a DNA molecule, the two antiparallel strands (positive or 5'-> 3' and negative or 3'-> 5') are complementary to each other
- As per standard notation, we write the DNA sequence in 5'-> 3' orientation. Therefore, to represent a sequence of the 
  negative strand in 5'-> 3' orientation we need to perform a reverse complementary of positive strand (e.g. reverse or 
  left primer)

**<span style="color:#33a8ff">How to obtain reverse complementary of DNA sequence?</span>**
- We will use `bioinfokit` 
- Check [bioinfokit documentation]({{"/blog/howtoinstall.html" | absolute_url }}) for installation and documentation
- Download test data <a href="/assets/posts/revcom/test.fa">dataset</a>

```python
# you can use interactive python interpreter, jupyter notebook, spyder or python code
# I am using interactive python interpreter (Python 3.7)
# find reverse complemenatry of a given DNA sequence
>>> from bioinfokit import analys
>>> analys.rev_com(seq="AGTCAGTAACTAG")
# output: CTAGTTACTGACT

# if you have sequences in a fasta file
>>> analys.rev_com(file="test.fa")
# output will be saved in same directory (output_revcom.fasta)
```
