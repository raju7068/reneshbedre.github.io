**<span style="color:#33a8ff">What is Reverse complementary?</span>**
- In a DNA molecule, the two antiparallel strands (positive or 5'-> 3' and negative or 3'-> 5') are complementary to each other
- As per standard notation, we write the DNA sequence in 5'-> 3' orientation. Therefore, to represent a sequence of negative strand in
  5'-> 3' orientation we need to perform a reverse complementary of positive strand (e.g. reverse or left primer)

**<span style="color:#33a8ff">How to obtain reverse complementary of DNA sequence?</span>**

```python
# We will use `bioinfokit` for reverse complementary analysis
# download and install bioinfokit (Tested on Linux, Mac, Windows)
git clone https://github.com/reneshbedre/bioinfokit.git
cd bioinfokit
python3 setup.py install
```

Download test data <a href="/myfiles/revcom/test.fa">dataset</a>

```python
# you can use interactive python console, jupyter or python code
# I am using interactive python console (Python 3.6)
# find reverse complemenatry of a given DNA sequence
>>>from bioinfokit import analys
>>>analys.rev_com(seq="AGTCAGTAACTAG")
# output: CTAGTTACTGACT

# if you have sequences in a fasta file
>>>analys.rev_com(file="test.fa")
# output will be saved in same directory (output_revcom.fasta)
```
