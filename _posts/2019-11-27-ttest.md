**<span style="color:#33a8ff">What is Two sample t-test (unpaired t-test)?</span>**
 - Used to compare the means of two independent groups 
 - For example, we have two different plant genotypes (genotype A and genotype B) and would like to compare if the yield
   of genotype A is significantly different from genotype B

**<span style="color:#33a8ff">Two sample t-test Hypotheses</span>**
 - <i>Null hypotheses</i>: Two group means are equal  
 - <i>Alternative hypotheses</i>: Two group means are different (two-tailed)
 - <i>Alternative hypotheses</i>: Mean of one group either greater or lesser than another group (one-tailed)
 
**<span style="color:#33a8ff">Two sample t-test Assumptions</span>** 
 - Two groups have normal distribution
 - Homogeneity of variances (variances are equal between treatment groups) (Levene)
 - Observations in two groups are sampled independently from each other

**<span style="color:#33a8ff">How to perform Two sample t-test in Python?</span>**

```python
# We will use `bioinfokit` for plotting 2 and 3-way Venn diagrams.
# download and install bioinfokit (Tested on Linux, Mac, Windows) 
# read instructions https://github.com/reneshbedre/bioinfokit
git clone https://github.com/reneshbedre/bioinfokit.git
cd bioinfokit
python setup.py install
```   

Download <a href="/assets/posts/ttest/genotype.csv">dataset</a> for two sample t-test 
```python
# you can use interactive python console, jupyter or python code
# I am using interactive python console (Python 3.6)
>>>from bioinfokit import analys
# Read documentation at https://github.com/reneshbedre/bioinfokit
>>>analys.ttsam(table="genotype.csv", xfac="Genotype", res="yield")
# it needs csv file. If you have tab delimited file, you can reformat to
# csv using bioinfokit.analys.tcsv(file) 
# read docs at https://github.com/reneshbedre/bioinfokit

# output

</p>

<b>Interpretation</b>: The P-value obtained from t-test is significant (P<0.05), and therefore, we conclude 
that the yield of genotype A is significantly different than genotype B.
