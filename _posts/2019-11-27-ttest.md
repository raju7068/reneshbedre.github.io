## <span style="color:#33a8ff">What is Two sample t-test (unpaired t-test)?</span>
 - Used to compare the means of two independent groups 
 - For example, we have two different plant genotypes (genotype A and genotype B) and would like to compare if the yield
   of genotype A is significantly different from genotype B

## <span style="color:#33a8ff">Two sample t-test Hypotheses</span>
 - <i>Null hypotheses</i>: Two group means are equal  
 - <i>Alternative hypotheses</i>: Two group means are different (two-tailed)
 - <i>Alternative hypotheses</i>: Mean of one group either greater or lesser than another group (one-tailed)
 
## <span style="color:#33a8ff">Two sample t-test Assumptions</span>
 - Two groups have a normal distribution
 - Homogeneity of variances (variances are equal between treatment groups) 
 - Observations in two groups are sampled independently from each other

## <span style="color:#33a8ff">How to perform Two sample t-test in Python?</span>
- We will use `bioinfokit` 
- Check [bioinfokit documentation]({{"/blog/howtoinstall.html" | absolute_url }}) for installation and documentation
- Download <a href="/assets/posts/ttest/genotype.csv">dataset</a> for two sample t-test 

```python
# you can use interactive python interpreter, jupyter notebook, spyder or python code
# I am using interactive python interpreter (Python 3.7)
>>> from bioinfokit import analys
>>> import pandas as pd
# Read documentation at https://github.com/reneshbedre/bioinfokit
>>> df = pd.read_csv("https://reneshbedre.github.io/assets/posts/ttest/genotype.csv")
>>> df.head()
  Genotype  yield
0        A   78.0
1        A   84.3
2        A   81.0
3        B   88.0
4        B   92.0
>>> analys.stat.ttsam(df=df, xfac="Genotype", res="yield")
# it needs csv file. If you have tab delimited file, you can reformat to
# csv using bioinfokit.analys.tcsv(file) 
# read docs at https://github.com/reneshbedre/bioinfokit

# output

### Interpretation
 The P-value obtained from the t-test is significant (P<0.05), and therefore, we conclude that the yield of genotype A is 
 significantly different than genotype B.
