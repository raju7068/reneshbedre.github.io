## <span style="color:#33a8ff">One Sample <em>t</em>-test </span>
- One Sample <em>t</em>-test is used to compare the sample mean (a random sample from a population) with the specific 
  value (hypothesized or known mean of the population).
- For example, a ball has a diameter of 5 cm and we want to check whether the average diameter of the ball from the random
  sample (e.g. 50 balls) picked from the production line differs from the known size.

### <span style="color:#33a8ff">Assumptions</span>
 - Dependent variable should have an approximately normal distribution (Shapiro-Wilks Test)
 - Observations are independent of each other
 
### <span style="color:#33a8ff">Hypotheses</span>
 - <i>Null hypotheses</i>: Sample mean is equal to the hypothesized or known population mean  
 - <i>Alternative hypotheses</i>: Sample mean is not equal to the hypothesized or known population mean (two-tailed or 
   two-sided)
 - <i>Alternative hypotheses</i>: Sample mean is either greater or lesser to the hypothesized or known population mean 
   (one-tailed or one-sided)

### <span style="color:#33a8ff">Formula</span>
   
   
   <p align="center">
  \(  \it{t} = \frac{ \bar{x} - \mu }{ s / \sqrt{n} }  \)
  </p>
  
   <p> It follows approximately  \( \it{t}\)-distribution with  \(n-1 \) degrees of freedom </p>
  
<p>  Where, \(\bar{x} \) = sample mean; \(\mu \) = hypothesized or known population mean; \(\it{s} \)= sample standard
  deviation (estimate of population standard deviation \(\sigma \)), and \(\it{n} \) is the sample size </p>

### <span style="color:#33a8ff">How to perform one sample <em>t</em>-test in Python?</span>
- We will use `bioinfokit v0.9.6` or later

```python
# I am using interactive python interpreter (Python 3.7.4)
>>> from bioinfokit.analys import get_data, stat
# load dataset as pandas dataframe
# the dataset should not have missing (NaN) values. If it has, it will omitted
>>> df = get_data('t_one_samp').data
>>> df.head()
       size
0  5.739987
1  5.254042
2  5.152388
3  4.870819
4  3.536251

>>> res = stat()
>>> res.ttest(df=df, test_type=1, res='size', mu=5)
# output
>>> print(res.summary)

One Sample t-test

------------------  --------
Sample size         50
Mean                 5.05128
t                    0.36789
Df                  49
P-value (one-tail)   0.35727
P-value (two-tail)   0.71454
Lower 95.0%          4.77116
Upper 95.0%          5.3314
------------------  --------
```   

### Interpretation
The <i>p</i> value obtained from the one sample <em>t</em>-test is not significant (<i>p</i> > 0.05), and therefore, we 
conclude that the average diameter of the balls in a random sample is equal to  5 cm.

## <span style="color:#33a8ff">Two sample <em>t</em>-test (unpaired or independent <em>t</em>-test)</span>
 - Two Sample independent <em>t</em>-test Used to compare the means of two independent groups 
 - For example, we have two different plant genotypes (genotype A and genotype B) and would like to compare if the yield
   of genotype A is significantly different from genotype B

### Two sample <em>t</em>-test Hypotheses
 - <i>Null hypotheses</i>: Two group means are equal  
 - <i>Alternative hypotheses</i>: Two group means are different (two-tailed or two-sided)
 - <i>Alternative hypotheses</i>: Mean of one group either greater or lesser than another group (one-tailed or one-sided)
 
### Two sample <em>t</em>-test Assumptions
 - Observations in two groups have an approximately normal distribution (Shapiro-Wilks Test)
 - Homogeneity of variances (variances are equal between treatment groups) (Levene or Bartlett Test)
 - The two groups are sampled independently from each other from the same population

### <span style="color:#33a8ff">Formula</span>
   
   
   <p align="center">
  \(  \it{t} = \frac{ \bar{x_1} - \bar{x_2} }{   \sqrt{s^2 (\frac{1}{n_1} + \frac{1}{n_2}) } }  \)
  </p>
  
  <p> It follows approximately  \( \it{t}\)-distribution with  \(n_1+n_2-1 \) degrees of freedom </p>
  
<p>  Where, \(\bar{x_1} \) and  \( \bar{x_2}\) = means for two independent samples; \(\it{s^2} \)= pooled sample 
variance (estimate of unknown population variance \(\sigma^2\) ), and \(\it{n_1} \) and \(\it{n_2} \)  are the sample 
size for two independent samples </p>

<p> \(\it{s^2} \) is calculated as, </p>

   <p align="center">
  \(  \it{s^2}  = \frac{ (n_1-1) s_{x_1}^2 + (n_2-1) s_{x_2}^2  }{ n_1+n_2-2 }  \)
  </p>

<p>  Where, \(s_{x_1}^2 \) and \(s_{x_2}^2\)= sample variances (estimate of unknown population variances \(\sigma_{x_1}^2\) 
    and  \(\sigma_{x_2}^2\)  ) </p>

<p> For Welch's test (where group variances are not equal) </p>

<p align="center">
  \(  \it{t} = \frac{ \mid \bar{x_1} - \bar{x_2} \mid }{   \sqrt{ \frac{s_{x_1}^2}{n_1} + \frac{s_{x_2}^2}{n_2} } }  \)
  </p>

<p> It follows approximately  \( \it{t}\)-distribution with  \(\nu \) degrees of freedom </p>

 <p align="center">
  \(  \nu  = \frac{ (s_{x_1}^2/n_1 + s_{x_2}^2/n_2)^2  }{ \frac{ (s_{x_1}^2/n_1)^2 }{n_1-1} + \frac{ (s_{x_2}^2/n_2)^2 }{n_2-1} }  \)
  </p>

<b>Note</b>: Even though you can perform a <em>t</em>-test when the sample size is unequal between two groups, it is more 
efficient to have an equal sample size in two groups to increase the power of the <em>t</em>-test.

### Interpretation
The <i>p</i> value obtained from the <em>t</em>-test is significant (<i>p</i> < 0.05), and therefore, we conclude that the 
yield of genotype A is significantly different than genotype B.


## <span style="color:#33a8ff">Paired <em>t</em>-test (dependent <em>t</em>-test)</span>
- Paired <em>t</em>-test used to compare the differences between the pair of dependent variables for the same 
  subject 
- For example, we have plant variety A and would like to compare the yield of A before and after the 
  application of some fertilizer
- <b>Note</b>: Paired <em>t</em>-test is a one sample <em>t</em>-test on the differences between the two dependent variables

### Paired <em>t</em>-test Hypotheses
 - <i>Null hypotheses</i>: There is no difference between the two dependent variables (difference=0)
 - <i>Alternative hypotheses</i>: There is a difference between the two dependent variables  (two-tailed or two-sided)
 - <i>Alternative hypotheses</i>: Difference between two response variables either greater or lesser than zero 
   (one-tailed or one-sided)
   
### Paired <em>t</em>-test Assumptions
- Differences between the two dependent variables follows an approximately normal distribution (Shapiro-Wilks Test)
- Independent variable should have a pair of dependent variables
- Differences between the two dependent variables should not have outliers
- Observations are sampled independently from each other   

### <span style="color:#33a8ff">Formula</span>
   
   
   <p align="center">

  </p>
  
   <p> It follows approximately  \( \it{t}\)-distribution with  \(n-1 \) degrees of freedom </p>
  
<p>  Where, \(\bar{d} \) = mean of sample differences; \(\it{s_d} \)= standard
  deviation of sample differences (estimate of population standard deviation \(\sigma_d \)), and \(\it{n} \) is the 
  sample size </p>

------------------  ------------
```

### Interpretation
The <i>p</i> value obtained from the <em>t</em>-test is significant (<i>p</i> < 0.05), and therefore, we conclude that the 
yield of plant variety A significantly increased by the application of fertilizer.
