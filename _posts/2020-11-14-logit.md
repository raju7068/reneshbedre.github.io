## <span style="color:#33a8ff">What is logistic regression?</span>
- Logistic regression (logit model) explains the binary/dichotomous response variable (outcome as 0 and 1, yes and no, or 
  true and false) as a linear combinations of the single or multiple independent variables (discrete,  continous, or 
  categorical variables)
- In logistic regression, the probability or odds of the response variable (instead of values as in linear regression)
  are modeled as function of the independent variables
- For example, prediction of death or survival of patients, which can be coded as 0 and 1, respectively can be
  predicted by one or more metabolic markers.

## <span style="color:#33a8ff">Logistic regression model</span>

<p align="center">
  \( ln\frac{\it{p}(y)}{1-\it{p}(y)} = a + b_1x_1 + b_2x_2 + b_3x_3 + ... + b_nx_n  \) 
  </p>
  
  <p>
  Where, \(  ln[ \frac{\it{p}(y)}{1-\it{p}(y)}] \)  = natural log of odds, <br>
         \( x_1, x_2, ..., x_n \) = independent variables <br>
         a = y-intercept, <br> \( b_1, b_2, ..., b_n \) = slope of the regression <br>
         Intercept and slopes are also called coefficients of regression
  </p>
  
  <p> Logistic regression model follow binomial distribution and the regression parameters are estimated using the
    maximum likelihood function --- check this </p>

## <span style="color:#33a8ff">Odds and Odds ratio (OR)</span>
- Odds is the ratio of the probability of event happening to the probability of event not happening 
  (<i>p</i> &#8725; 1-<i>p</i>). Odds can range from 0 to &#8734;.
- Odds ratio (OR) is the ratio of two odds. OR can range from 0 to &#8734;. 


## <span style="color:#33a8ff">Logistic regression in pythom</span>
- We will use sklearn and bioinfokit (v1.0.4 or later)

```python
# I am using interactive python interpreter (Python 3.7.4)
from bioinfokit.analys import get_data
# get dataset for model training
df_train = get_data('wdbc_train').data
df_train.head()

- This dataset represents the characteristics of breast cancer cell nuclei computed from the digitized images 
  (Dua and Graff 2019; Dr. William H. Wolberg, University Of Wisconsin Hospital at Madison). 
- The features calculated from the digitized cell images includes, radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, 
  compactness, concavity, concave points, symmetry, and fractal dimension for mean , standard error, and largest 
  (worst) values (total 30 features provided in dataframe from column 3-32)
- The outcome (response variable) measured as malignant (M) or benign (B) (see dign variable in dataframe)
- Using logistic regression model, I will build a classifier to predict the the outcome as M or B from given test 
  samples
