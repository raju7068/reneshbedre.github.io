## <span style="color:#33a8ff">What is logistic regression?</span>
- Logistic regression (logit model) explains the binary/dichotomous response variable (outcome as 0 and 1, yes and no, or 
  true and false) as a linear combinations of the single or multiple independent variables (discrete,  continous, or 
  categorical variables)
- In logistic regression, the probability or odds of the response variable (instead of values as in linear regression)
  are modeled as function of the independent variables
- For example, prediction of death or survival of patients, which can be coded as 0 and 1, respectively can be
  predicted by one or more metabolic markers.

## <span style="color:#33a8ff">Logistic regression model</span>

<p align="center">
  \( ln\frac{\it{p}(y)}{1-\it{p}(y)} = a + b_1x_1 + b_2x_2 + b_3x_3 + ... + b_nx_n  \) 
  </p>
  
  <p>
  Where, \(  ln[ \frac{\it{p}(y)}{1-\it{p}(y)}] \)  = natural log of odds, <br>
         \( x_1, x_2, ..., x_n \) = independent variables <br>
         a = y-intercept, <br> \( b_1, b_2, ..., b_n \) = slope of the regression <br>
         Intercept and slopes are also called coefficients of regression
  </p>
  
  <p> Logistic regression model follow binomial distribution and the coefficients of regression are estimated using the
    maximum likelihood function. The Logistic regression model the output as the odds which assign the probability to  
    the observations for classification </p>

## <span style="color:#33a8ff">Odds and Odds ratio (OR)</span>
- Odds is the ratio of the probability of event happening to the probability of event not happening 
  (<i>p</i> &#8725; 1-<i>p</i>). Odds can range from 0 to &#8734;.
- Odds ratio (OR) is the ratio of two odds. OR can range from 0 to &#8734;. 


## <span style="color:#33a8ff">Logistic regression in pythom</span>
- We will use sklearn and bioinfokit (v1.0.4 or later)

```python
# I am using interactive python interpreter (Python 3.7.4)
from bioinfokit.analys import get_data
# get dataset for model training
df_train = get_data('wdbc_train').data
df_train.head()

- This dataset represents the characteristics of breast cancer cell nuclei computed from the digitized images 
  (Dua and Graff 2019; Dr. William H. Wolberg, University Of Wisconsin Hospital at Madison). 
- The features calculated from the digitized cell images includes, radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, 
  compactness, concavity, concave points, symmetry, and fractal dimension for mean , standard error, and largest 
  (worst) values. We have only used mean values of these features for regression analysis.
- The outcome (response variable) measured as malignant (1) or benign (0) (see dign variable in dataframe)
- Using logistic regression model, I will build a classifier to predict the the outcome as malignant or benign from given test 
  samples

```python
# logistic regression model
import statsmodels.api as sm 
# get independent variables
X = df_train.iloc[:,2:12]
# get response variables
Y = df_train[['dign']]
# fit the model with maximum likelihood function
model = sm.Logit(endog=Y, exog=X).fit()
# message
