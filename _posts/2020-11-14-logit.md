## <span style="color:#33a8ff">What is logistic regression?</span>
- Logistic regression (logit model) explains the binary/dichotomous response variable (outcome as 0 and 1, yes and no, or 
  true and false) as a linear combinations of the single or multiple independent variables (discrete,  continous, or 
  categorical variables)
- In logistic regression, the probability or odds of the response variable (instead of values as in linear regression)
  are modeled as function of the independent variables
- For example, prediction of death or survival of patients, which can be coded as 0 and 1, respectively can be
  predicted by one or more metabolic markers.

  \( ln\frac{\it{p}(y)}{1-\it{p}(y)} = a + b_1x_1 + b_2x_2 + b_3x_3 + ... + b_nx_n  \) <br>
  Where, \(  ln[ \frac{\it{p}(y)}{1-\it{p}(y)}] \)  = natural log of odds ratio, <br>
         \( x_1, x_2 ... x_n \) = independent variables <br>
         </br>a = y-intercept, b = slope of the regression
