## <span style="color:#33a8ff">Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)?</span>
- Before starting this tutorial, read basics about the [linear regression]({{"/blog/linearreg.html" | absolute_url }})
- In MLR, linear relationships between Y (dependent/response/criterion/endogeneous) and X (explanatory/independent/predictor/regressor/exogeneous)
  variables can be explained by multiple X variables

- We will use `bioinfokit v0.7.2` or later for performing MLR.
- Check [How to install bioinfokit]({{"/blog/howtoinstall.html" | absolute_url }}) for latest version.
- Download [dataset]({{"/assets/posts/reg/test_reg.csv" | absolute_url }})


```python
# you can use interactive python interpreter, jupyter notebook, google colab, spyder or python code
# I am using interactive python interpreter (Python 3.8.2)
>>> from bioinfokit.analys import stat, get_data
# load dataset as pandas dataframe. it should not have missing values.
>>> df = get_data('mlr').data
>>> df.head()

### Interpretation
- The regression line with equation [Y = 521.4505 + (3.258*X1) + (0.1651*X2)], is helpful to predict the value of the Y variable
  from the given value of the X variables (X1 and X2). In general, a regression can be useful in predicting the Y of any value
  within the range of X. It can be also used to predict Y from X outside the given range, but such extrapolation may
  not be useful
- The slope (3.25799 and 0.165104) represents the change in the Y per unit change in the X variable when other X variables remain constant.
  It means that the value Y increases by 3.25799 with each unit increase in X1 when X2 is constant. Similarly, value Y
  increases by 0.165104 with each unit increase in X2 when X1 is constant. The regression coefficients should be interpreted
  confidently only if they are statistically  significant (P<0.05)
- The intercept (521.45) represents the value of Y when all X variables have a value of 0 (X1=0 and X2=0). Here need to be cautious to
  interpret intercept as sometimes the value (X1=0) does not make any sense (e.g. speed of car or height of the person). In such cases, the
  values within the range of X should be considered to interpret the intercept
- The coefficient of determination (r-squared) is 0.918 (91.8%), which suggests that 91.8% of the variance in Y can be
  explained by X variables (X1 and X2). In MLR, adjusted r-squared is more appropriate than r-squared as an increasing number of
  X variables also increases r-squared
- From Regression Coefficients, the P-value obtained for X1 and X2 is significant (<0.05), it suggests
  that X1 and X2 significantly influence the response variable Y (there is a significant relationship between X and Y)
- From ANOVA, the P-value is significant (<0.05), which suggests that there is a significant relationship between X and Y.
  The X variables can reliably predict the Y variable
- In MLR, multicollinearity (the relationship between the X variables) is often a problem. It causes inflation of variance,
  changes in the signs and confidence intervals of regression coefficients (Ryan, 2008). Therefore, it is necessary to detect and eliminate
  multicollinearity. Multicollinearity can be detected using Variance inflation factor (VIF)
  - Generally, VIF > 5 or > 10 suggests the multicollinearity (Vatcheva et al., 2016). But this is not a universal agreement and VIF < 5 could also suggest
    the multicollinearity (Vatcheva et al., 2016)
  - If VIF < 2 is a good indicator of the absence of strong multicollinearity and VIF = 1 indicates completely absence of multicollinearity
  - Sometimes, a correlation coefficient > 0.5 among the X variables can be used to detect the multicollinearity (Vatcheva et al., 2016)
  - To remove the multicollinearity you can either take more measurements or remove the variables causing multicollinearity or
    perform the ridge regression (Ryan, 2008)

- In MLR result, the VIF for both of the X variables (X1=1.64824 and X2=1.64824) are < 2 and suggests there is no strong relationship between the
  X variables

### Check Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) Assumptions

<u>Residuals vs fitted (y_hat) plot</u>: This plot used to check for linearity, variances and outliers in
the regression data
```python
# get residuals and standardized residuals and add to original dataframe
>>> df['yhat']=reg.y_hat
>>> df['res']=reg.residuals
>>> df['std_res']=reg.std_residuals
>>> df.head()
   X1   X2    Y        yhat       res   std_res
0  25  390  670  667.290604  2.709396  0.451566
1  30  398  690  684.901388  5.098612  0.849769
2  18  328  635  634.248248  0.751752  0.125292
3  15  320  625  623.153447  1.846553  0.307759
4  20  335  640  641.919955 -1.919955 -0.319993

# create fitted (y_hat) vs residuals plot
>>> visuz.stat.reg_resid_plot(df=df, yhat='yhat', resid='res', stdresid='std_res')
# plot will be saved in same dir (resid_plot.png and std_resid_plot.png)
# set parameter show=True, if you want view the image instead of saving
```

<img src="/assets/posts/reg/mlr/std_resid_plot.png" width="500">
</p>

From the plot,
- As the data is pretty equally distributed around the line=0 in the residual plot, it meets the assumption of residual
  equal variances. The outliers could be detected here if the data lies far away from the line=0.
- In the standardized residual plot, the residuals are within -2 and +2 range and suggest that it meets assumptions of
  linearity

<u>Quantile-quantile (QQ) plot</u>: This plot used to check the data normality assumption

```python
>>> import statsmodels.api as sm
>>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
# check dataframe for required variables (we will need std_res variable for QQ plot)
>>> df.head()
   X1   X2    Y        yhat       res   std_res
0  25  390  670  667.290604  2.709396  0.451566
1  30  398  690  684.901388  5.098612  0.849769
2  18  328  635  634.248248  0.751752  0.125292
3  15  320  625  623.153447  1.846553  0.307759
4  20  335  640  641.919955 -1.919955 -0.319993

# create QQ plot
# line=45 option to plot the data around 45 degree line
>>> sm.qqplot(df['std_res'], line='45')
>>> plt.xlabel("Theoretical Quantiles")
>>> plt.ylabel("Standardized Residuals")
>>> plt.show()

```

From the plot,
- As the standardized residuals lie around the 45-degree line, it suggests that the residuals are normally distributed
