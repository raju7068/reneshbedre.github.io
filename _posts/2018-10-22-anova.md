**<span style="color:#33a8ff">What is ANOVA (ANalysis Of VAriance)?</span>**
 - used to compare the means of more than 2 groups (t-test can be used to compare 2 groups)
 - groups mean differences inferred by analyzing variances
 - Main types: One-way (one factor) and two-way (two factors) ANOVA (factor is an independent variable)
 
 Note: In ANOVA, group, factors, and independent variables are similar terms
 
**<span style="color:#33a8ff">ANOVA Hypotheses</span>**
 - <i>Null hypotheses</i>: Groups means are equal (no variation in means of groups)
 - <i>Alternative hypotheses</i>: At least, one group mean is different from other groups
 
**<span style="color:#33a8ff">ANOVA Assumptions</span>** 
 - Residuals (experimental error) are normally distributed (Shapiro Wilks Test)
 - Homogeneity of variances (variances are equal between treatment groups) (Levene or Bartlett Test)
 - Observations are sampled independently from each other
 
**<span style="color:#33a8ff">How ANOVA works?</span>** 
 - Check sample sizes: equal number of observation in each group
 - Calculate Mean Square for each group (MS) (SS of group/level-1);
   level-1 is a degree of freedom (df) for a group
 - Calculate Mean Square error (MSE) (SS error/df of residuals)
 - Calculate F-value (MS of group/MSE)

Example data for one-way ANOVA analysis, [dataset]({{"/assets/posts/anova/onewayanova.txt" | absolute_url }})

Here, there are four treatments (A, B, C, and D), which are groups for ANOVA analysis. Treatments are independent 
variable and termed as factor. As there are four types of treatments, treatment factor has four levels. 

For this experimental design, there is only factor (treatments) or independent variable to evaluate, and therefore, 
one-way ANOVA is suitable for analysis.

# between different treatments

```python
# load packages
import scipy.stats as stats
# stats f_oneway functions takes the groups as input and returns F and P-value
fvalue, pvalue = stats.f_oneway(d['A'], d['B'], d['C'], d['D'])
print(fvalue, pvalue)
# 17.492810457516338 2.639241146210922e-05

d_melt = pd.melt(d.reset_index(), id_vars=['index'], value_vars=['A', 'B', 'C', 'D'])
# replace column names
d_melt.columns = ['index', 'treatments', 'value']
# Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) model
model = ols('value ~ C(treatments)', data=d_melt).fit()
anova_table = sm.stats.anova_lm(model, typ=2)
anova_table

|                |  df   | sum_sq  | mean_sq  |  F       |  PR(>F)  |
|---------------|--------|---------|----------|----------|----------|
| C(treatments) | 3.0    | 3010.95 | 1003.650 | 17.49281 | 0.000026 |
| Residual      | 16.0   | 918.00  | 57.375   | NaN      | NaN      |
```

<b>Interpretation</b>: The P-value obtained from ANOVA analysis is significant (P<0.05), and therefore, we conclude 
that there are significant differences among treatments.

From ANOVA analysis, we know that treatment differences are statistically significant, but ANOVA does not tell which 
treatments are significantly different from each other. To know the pairs of significant different treatments, we
will perform multiple pairwise comparison (<b>Post-hoc comparison</b>) analysis using <b>Tukey HSD</b> test.

```python
# load packages
from statsmodels.stats.multicomp import pairwise_tukeyhsd
# perform multiple pairwise comparison (Tukey HSD)
m_comp = pairwise_tukeyhsd(endog=d_melt['value'], groups=d_melt['treatments'], alpha=0.05)
print(m_comp)

Multiple Comparison of Means - Tukey HSD,FWER=0.05
==============================================
group1 group2 meandiff  lower    upper  reject
----------------------------------------------
  A      B      15.4    1.6929  29.1071  True 
  A      C      1.6    -12.1071 15.3071 False 
  A      D      30.4   16.6929  44.1071  True 
  B      C     -13.8   -27.5071 -0.0929  True 
  B      D      15.0    1.2929  28.7071  True 
  C      D      28.8   15.0929  42.5071  True 
----------------------------------------------
```

Above results from Tukey HSD suggests that except A-C, all other pairwise comparisons for treatments rejects null 
hypothesis and indicates statistical significant differences.

The <b>Shapiro-Wilk test</b> can be used to check the <b> normal distribution of residuals </b>. <i>Null hypothesis</i>: 
data is drawn from normal distribution.

```python
# load packages
import scipy.stats as stats
w, pvalue = stats.shapiro(model.resid)
print(w, pvalue)
# 0.9685019850730896 0.7229772806167603
```

As the P-value is non significant, we fail to reject null hypothesis and
conclude that data is drawn from normal distribution.

As the data is drawn from normal distribution, use Bartlettâ€™s test 
to check the <b>Homogeneity of variances</b>.
 <i>Null hypothesis</i>: samples from populations 
have equal variances.

```python
# load packages
import scipy.stats as stats
w, pvalue = stats.bartlett(d['A'], d['B'], d['C'], d['D'])
print(w, pvalue)
5.687843565012841 0.1278253399753447
```
As the P-value (0.12) is non significant, we fail to reject null 
hypothesis and conclude that treatments have equal variances.

<b>Levene test</b> can be used to check the Homogeneity of variances
when the data is not drawn from normal distribution.

<!--
```python
# load packages
import scipy.stats as stats
w, pvalue = stats.levene(d['A'], d['B'], d['C'], d['D'])
print(w, pvalue)
# 1.9219593192195938 0.16673281219949276

**<span style="color:#33a8ff">Two-way (two factor) ANOVA</span>**  

Example data for two-way ANOVA analysis, [dataset]({{"/assets/posts/anova/twowayanova.txt" | absolute_url }})

From dataset, there are two factors (independent variables) viz. genotypes and yield in years. Genotypes and years has 
five and three levels respectively (see one-way ANOVA to know factors and levels).

For this experimental design, there are two factors to evaluate, and therefore, two-way ANOVA is suitable for analysis. 
Here, using two-way ANOVA, we can simultaneously evaluate how type of genotype and years affects the yields of plants. If
you apply one-way ANOVA here, you can able to evaluate only one factor at a time. 

From two-way ANOVA, we can tests three hypotheses 1) effect of genotype on yield 2) effect of time (years) on yield, and
3) effect of genotype and time (years) interactions on yield

```python
# load packages
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
# load data file
d = pd.read_csv("https://reneshbedre.github.io/assets/posts/anova/twowayanova.txt", sep="\t")
# reshape the d dataframe suitable for statsmodels package 
# you do not need to reshape if your data is already in stacked format. Compare d and d_melt tables for detail 
# understanding 
d_melt = pd.melt(d, id_vars=['Genotype'], value_vars=['1_year', '2_year', '3_year'])
# replace column names
d_melt.columns = ['Genotype', 'years', 'value']
# generate a boxplot to see the data distribution by genotypes and years. Using boxplot, we can easily detect the 
# differences between different groups
sns.boxplot(x="Genotype", y="value", hue="years", data=d_melt, palette="Set3") 
```

![screenshot]({{ "/assets/posts/anova/twowayanova_boxplot.png" | absolute_url }})

```python
# load packages
import statsmodels.api as sm
from statsmodels.formula.api import ols
# Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) model
# C(Genotype):C(years) represent interaction term
model = ols('value ~ C(Genotype) + C(years) + C(Genotype):C(years)', data=d_melt).fit()
anova_table = sm.stats.anova_lm(model, typ=2)
anova_table

|                      | sum_sq     | df   |     F      |    PR(>F)    |
|----------------------|------------|------|------------|--------------|
| C(Genotype)          | 58.551733  | 5.0  | 32.748581  | 1.931655e-12 |
| C(years)             | 278.925633 | 2.0  | 390.014868 | 4.006243e-25 |
| C(Genotype):C(years) | 17.122967  | 10.0 | 4.788525   | 2.230094e-04 |
| Residual             | 12.873000  | 36.0 | NaN        | NaN          |
```

<b>Interpretation</b>: The P-value obtained from ANOVA analysis for genotype, years, and interaction are statistically 
significant (P<0.05). We conclude that type of genotype significantly affects the yield outcome, time (years) 
significantly affects the yield outcome, and interaction of both genotype and time (years) significantly affects the 
yield outcome.

Now, we know that genotype and time (years) differences are statistically significant, but ANOVA does not tell which 
genotype and time (years) are significantly different from each other. To know the pairs of significant different 
genotype and time (years), perform multiple pairwise comparison (<b>Post-hoc comparison</b>) analysis using 
<b>Tukey HSD</b> test.

Similar to one-way ANOVA, you can use <b>Levene</b> and <b>Shapiro-Wilk test</b> to validate the assumptions for
homogeneity of variances and normal distribution of residuals.

- three factor designs can be analyzed in a similar way to two-way ANOVA
