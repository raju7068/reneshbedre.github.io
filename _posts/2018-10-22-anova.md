**<span style="color:#33a8ff">What is ANOVA (ANalysis Of VAriance)?</span>**
 - used to compare the means of more than 2 groups (t-test can be used to compare 2 groups)
 - groups mean differences inferred by analyzing variances
 - Main types: One-way (one factor) and two-way (two factors) ANOVA (factor is an independent variable)
 
**<span style="color:#33a8ff">ANOVA Hypotheses</span>**
 - <i>Null hypotheses</i>: Groups means are equal (no variation in means of groups)
 - <i>Alternative hypotheses</i>: At least, one group mean is different from other groups
 
**<span style="color:#33a8ff">ANOVA Assumptions</span>** 
 - Residuals (experimental error) are normally distributed (Shapiro Wilks Test)
 - Homogeneity of variances (variances are equal between treatment groups) (Levene or Bartlett Test)
 - Observations are sampled independently from each other
 
**<span style="color:#33a8ff">How ANOVA works?</span>** 
 - Check sample sizes: equal number of observation in each group
 - Calculate Mean Square Error (MSE): mean of the group variances
 - Calculate Mean Square Between (MSB)

Example data for one-way ANOVA analysis, [dataset]({{"/myfiles/anova/onewayanova.txt" | absolute_url }})

| A  | B  | C  | D  |
|----|----|----|----|
| 25 | 45 | 30 | 54 |
| 30 | 55 | 29 | 60 |
| 28 | 29 | 33 | 51 |
| 36 | 56 | 37 | 62 |
| 29 | 40 | 27 | 73 |

Here, there are four treatments (A, B, C, and D), which are groups for ANOVA analysis. Treatments are independent 
variable and termed as factor. As there are four types of treatments, treatment factor has four levels. 

For this experimental design, there is only factor (treatments) or independent variable to evaluate, and therefore, 
one-way ANOVA is suitable for analysis.


```python
import pandas as pd

# load data file
d = pd.read_csv("https://reneshbedre.github.io/myfiles/anova/onewayanova.txt", sep="\t")

# generate a boxplot to see the data distribution by treatments. Using boxplot, we can easily detect the differences 
# between different treatments
d.boxplot(column=['A', 'B', 'C', 'D'], grid=False)
```

```python
import scipy.stats as stats
# stats f_oneway functions takes the groups as input and returns F and P-value
fvalue, pvalue = stats.f_oneway(d['A'], d['B'], d['C'], d['D'])
print(fvalue, pvalue)
# 17.492810457516338 2.639241146210922e-05

# get ANOVA table as R like output
import statsmodels.api as sm
from statsmodels.formula.api import ols
# reshape the d dataframe suitable for statsmodels package 
d_melt = pd.melt(d.reset_index(), id_vars=['index'], value_vars=['A', 'B', 'C', 'D'])
# replace column names
d_melt.columns = ['index', 'treatments', 'value']
# Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) model
model = ols('value ~ C(treatments)', data=d_melt).fit()
anova_table = sm.stats.anova_lm(model, typ=2)
anova_table

| df            | sum_sq | mean_sq | F        | PR(>F)   |          |
|---------------|--------|---------|----------|----------|----------|
| C(treatments) | 3.0    | 3010.95 | 1003.650 | 17.49281 | 0.000026 |
| Residual      | 16.0   | 918.00  | 57.375   | NaN      | NaN      |
```

<b>Interpretation</b>: The P-value obtained from ANOVA analysis is significant (P<0.05), and therefore, we conclude 
that there are significant differences among treatments.

From ANOVA analysis, we know that treatment differences are statistically significant, but ANOVA does not tell which 
treatments are significantly different from each other. To know the pairs of significant different treatments, we
will perform multiple pairwise comparison (<b>Post-hoc comparison</b>) analysis using <b>Tukey HSD</b> test.

```python
# load packages
from statsmodels.stats.multicomp import pairwise_tukeyhsd
from statsmodels.stats.multicomp import MultiComparison

# perform multiple pairwise comparison (Tukey HSD)
m_comp = MultiComparison(d_melt['value'], d_melt['treatments'])
m_comp_res = m_comp.tukeyhsd()
print(m_comp_res)

Multiple Comparison of Means - Tukey HSD,FWER=0.05
==============================================
group1 group2 meandiff  lower    upper  reject
----------------------------------------------
  A      B      15.4    1.6929  29.1071  True 
  A      C      1.6    -12.1071 15.3071 False 
  A      D      30.4   16.6929  44.1071  True 
  B      C     -13.8   -27.5071 -0.0929  True 
  B      D      15.0    1.2929  28.7071  True 
  C      D      28.8   15.0929  42.5071  True 
----------------------------------------------
```

Above results from Tukey HSD suggests that except A-C, all other pairwise comparisons for treatments rejects null 
hypothesis and indicates statistical significant differences.

<b>Levene test</b> can be used to check the <b>Homogeneity of variances</b>. <i>Null hypothesis</i>: samples from populations 
have equal variances.

```python
# load packages
import scipy.stats as stats
w, pvalue = stats.levene(d['A'], d['B'], d['C'], d['D'])
print(w, pvalue)
# 1.9219593192195938 0.16673281219949276
```

As the P-value is non significant, we fail to reject null hypothesis and conclude that treatments have equal variances.

The <b>Shapiro-Wilk test</b> can be used to check the <b> normal distribution of residuals </b>. <i>Null hypothesis</i>: 
data is drawn from normal distribution.

```python
# load packages
import scipy.stats as stats
w, pvalue = stats.shapiro(model.resid)
print(w, pvalue)
# 0.9685019850730896 0.7229772806167603
```

As the P-value is non significant, we fail to reject null hypothesis and conclude that data is drawn from normal 
distribution.
