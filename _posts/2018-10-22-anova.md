**<span style="color:#33a8ff">What is ANOVA (ANalysis Of VAriance)?</span>**
 - used to compare the means of more than 2 groups (t-test can be used to compare 2 groups)
 - groups mean differences inferred by analyzing variances
 - Types: One-way (one factor) and two-way (two factors) ANOVA (factor is an independent variable)
 
**<span style="color:#33a8ff">ANOVA Hypotheses</span>**
 - <i>Null hypotheses</i>: Groups means are equal (no variation in means of groups)
 - <i>Alternative hypotheses</i>: At least, one group mean is different from other groups
 
**<span style="color:#33a8ff">ANOVA Assumptions</span>** 
 - Residuals are normally distributed (Shapiro Wilks Test)
 - Homogeneity of variances (variances are equal between treatment groups) (Bartlett Test)
 - Observations are sampled independently from each other
