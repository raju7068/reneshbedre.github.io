## <span style="color:#33a8ff"> Chi-square (χ2) test for independence (Pearson Chi-square test)</span>
 - Chi-square test is a non-parametric (distribution-free) method used to compare the relationship between the two 
   categorical (nominal) variables in a contingency table
 - For example, we have different treatments (treated and nontreated) and treatment outcomes (cured and noncured), here
   we could use the chi-square test for independence to check whether treatments are related to treatment outcomes.
 - Note: Chi-square test for independence is different than the 
   <a href='https://reneshbedre.github.io/blog/chisq.html#-what-is-a-chi-square-%CF%872-goodness-of-fit-test'>chi-square goodness of fit test</a>
 
### Hypotheses
 - <i>Null hypotheses</i>: The two categorical variables are independent (no association between the two variables)
 - <i>Alternative hypotheses</i>: The two categorical variables are dependent (there is an association between the two variables)
- Note: There are no one or two-tailed P-value. Rejection region of the chi-square test is always on the right side of 
  the distribution.
 
### Assumptions
- The two variables are categorical (nominal) and data is randomly sampled
- The levels of variables are mutually exclusive 
- The expected frequency count for at least 80% of the cell in a contingency table is at least 5
- The expected frequency count should not be less than 1
- Observations should be independent of each other
- Observation data should be frequency counts and not percentages or transformed data

### Perform a chi-square test for independence 
- We will use `bioinfokit` v0.9.5 or later
- Check [bioinfokit documentation]({{"/blog/howtoinstall.html" | absolute_url }}) for installation and documentation
- Download a hypothetical <a href="/assets/posts/chisq/drugdata.csv">dataset</a> for chi-square test for independence

```python
# I am using interactive python interpreter (Python 3.7.4)
>>> from bioinfokit.analys import stat, get_data
# load example dataset
>>> df = get_data('drugdata').data
>>> df.head()
   treatments  cured  noncured
0     treated     60        10
1  nontreated     30        25
# set treatments column as index
>>> df = df.set_index('treatments')
>>> df.head()
            cured  noncured
treatments
treated        60        10
nontreated     30        25

# run chi-square test for independence
>>> res = stat()
>>> res.chisq(df=df)

# output
>>> print(res.summary)

Chi-squared test for independence

Pearson            1       13.3365  0.000260291
Log-likelihood     1       13.4687  0.000242574

### Interpretation
The P-value obtained from chi-square test for independence is significant (P<0.05), and therefore, we conclude 
that there is a significant association between treatments (treated and nontreated) with treatment outcome 
(cured and noncured)


## <span style="color:#33a8ff"> Chi-square (χ2) Goodness of Fit test </span>
- Chi-square Goodness of Fit Test test is a non-parametric (distribution-free) method used to compare the observed and 
  expected values from one categorical variable. The expected values are calculated based on the known theoretical 
  expectation.
- For example, we have resistant (A)  and susceptible (B) genotypes for some disease. The crosses between these
  two genotypes will produce offspring in 3:1  (75% A and 25% B genotype) as per Mendelian ratio assuming resistance to 
  disease is a dominant trait. Here, we could use the chi-square Goodness of Fit Test test to check whether observed 
  counts of A and B genotypes are similar to expected counts of A and B genotypes as per the Mendelian ratio.
  
### Hypotheses  
 - <i>Null hypotheses</i>: The observed and expected counts in each group are equal
 - <i>Alternative hypotheses</i>: The observed and expected counts in each group are different
  
### Assumptions
- The variable should be categorical (nominal) and data is randomly sampled
- The groups of variables are mutually exclusive 
- The expected count should be at least 5 for each group
- Observations should be independent of each other
- Observation data should be frequency counts and not percentages or transformed data  
  
### Perform a Goodness of Fit test Python
- We will use `bioinfokit` v0.9.5 or later
- Check [bioinfokit documentation]({{"/blog/howtoinstall.html" | absolute_url }}) for installation and documentation

```python
# I am using interactive python interpreter (Python 3.7)
>>> from bioinfokit.analys import stat
>>> import pandas as pd
# create or import pandas dataframe of observed counts
>>> df = pd.DataFrame({'genotypes':['A', 'B'], 'observed':[155, 45]})
>>> df = df.set_index(['genotypes'])
>>> df.head()
           observed
genotypes
A               155
B                45

# run chi-square test 
>>> res = stat()
# p should be known theoretical expectation and must sum to 1
>>> res.chisq(df=df, p=(0.75, 0.25))

# output
>>> print(res.summary)

Chi-squared goodness of fit test

  Chi-Square    Df    P-value    Sample size
------------  ----  ---------  -------------
    0.666667     1   0.414216            200

# get expected counts
>>> print(res.expected_df)
           observed  expected_counts
genotypes
A               155            150.0
B                45             50.0

``` 

### Interpretation
The P-value obtained from the chi-square Goodness of Fit test  is non-significant (P>0.05 and fail to reject the null 
hypothesis), and therefore, we conclude that the observed genotypes counts after crosses is similar to that of expected 
counts as per the Mendelian ratio.
