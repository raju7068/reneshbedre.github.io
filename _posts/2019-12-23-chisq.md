**<span style="color:#33a8ff">What is a Chi-square (Ï‡2) test for independence (Pearson Chi-square test)?</span>**
 - Chi-square test is a non-parametric (distribution-free) method used to compare the relationship between the two 
   categorical (nominal) variables in a contingency table
 - For example, we have different treatments (treated and nontreated) and treatment outcomes (cured and noncured), here
   we could use the chi-square test for independence to check whether treatments are related to treatment outcomes.
 - Note: Chi-square test for independence is different than the chi-square goodness-of-fit test
 
**<span style="color:#33a8ff">Hypotheses</span>**
 - <i>Null hypotheses</i>: The two categorical variables are independent (no association between the two variables)
 - <i>Alternative hypotheses</i>: The two categorical variables are dependent (there is an association between the two variables)
- Note: There are no one or two-tailed P-value. Rejection region of chi-square test is always on the right side of the distribution.
 
**<span style="color:#33a8ff">Assumptions</span>**
- The two variables are categorical (nominal) and data is randomly sampled
- The levels of variables are mutually exclusive 
- The expected frequency count for at least 80% of the cell in a contingency table is at least 5
- The expected frequency count should not be less than 1
- Observations should be independent of each other
- Observation data should be frequency counts and not percentages or transformed data

**<span style="color:#33a8ff">How to perform a chi-square test for independence in Python?</span>**

```python
# install bioinfokit
# read instructions https://github.com/reneshbedre/bioinfokit
git clone https://github.com/reneshbedre/bioinfokit.git
cd bioinfokit
python setup.py install
```   

Download a hypothetical <a href="/myfiles/chisq/drugdata.csv">dataset</a> for chi-square test for independence

```python
# you can use interactive python console, jupyter or python code
# I am using interactive python console (Python 3.6)
>>>from bioinfokit import analys
# Read documentation at https://github.com/reneshbedre/bioinfokit
>>>analys.chisq(table="drugdata.csv")
# it needs csv file. If you have tab delimited file, you can reformat to
# csv using bioinfokit.analys.tcsv(file) 
# read docs at https://github.com/reneshbedre/bioinfokit

# output


Chi-squared test

Log-likelihood     1       13.4687  0.000242574

<b>Interpretation</b>: The P-value obtained from chi-square test for independence is significant (P<0.05), and therefore, we conclude 
that there is a significant association between treatments (treated and nontreated) with treatment outcome (cured and noncured)
