- The gene expression experiemnts such as RNA-sequening (RNA-seq) generates large number of sequencing reads (mRNA reads)
  which are expressed under different experimental conditions (e.g. normal vs treated)
- The mRNA count needs to analyse between experimental conditions to identify the gene expression changes. The differential
  expression analysis by comparing log fold changes (mostly log2 ratio) between experimental conditions is a commonly
  used approach.

- The common approach to analyze the
