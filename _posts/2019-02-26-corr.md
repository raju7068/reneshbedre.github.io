**<span style="color:#33a8ff">What is Correlation?</span>**
- Correlation used to identify the association between variables
- Correlation of two variables (pairwise) has values between -1 (negative correlation) and 1 (positive correlation)
- Statistical tests to measure correlation: Pearson, Spearman rank, Kendall Tau
- In bioinformatics, correlation can be used to identify coregulated gene expression, check quality of biological 
  replicates etc.

**<span style="color:#33a8ff">Calculating correlation in Python</span>** 

Sample dataset used in this tutorial [dataset]({{"/myfiles/corr/corr_dataset.csv" | absolute_url }}) to calculate 
correlation between variables. This sample gene expression dataset contains 13324 genes and 18 variables (A to R). 
These variables represent the log2 expression fold changes between different treatments.

```python
# I am using Jupyter notebook and Python3 
# load required packages
# make sure you have installed required packages
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.cm as cmc

# load data file
d = pd.read_csv("https://reneshbedre.github.io/myfiles/corr/corr_dataset.csv")

# perform correlation analysis
# by default, corr function uses pearson correlation method. if you want to use other test, provide explicit method
# parameter for kendall and spearman test eg. d_corr = d.corr(method='kendall')
d_corr = d.corr()

# print pairwise correlation matrix
print(d_corr)
# it will print correlation matrix with correlation coefficient for all variables

# visualize correlation matrix
# you can find mor colormaps (cmap) at https://matplotlib.org/tutorials/colors/colormaps.html
plt.matshow(d_corr, vmin=-1, vmax=1,cmap=cmc.seismic)
# scale
plt.colorbar()
plt.xticks([0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17], ["A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G", "H", "I", "J", "K", "L", "M", "N", "O", "P", "Q", "R"], fontsize=7)        
plt.yticks([0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17], ["A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G", "H", "I", "J", "K", "L", "M", "N", "O", "P", "Q", "R"], fontsize=7)              
plt.show()
# optional: to save high quality figure to a file
plt.savefig('corr.png', format='png', bbox_inches='tight', dpi=300)
```

Generated correlation plot by above code (red: positive correlation and blue: negative correlation),

To perform correlation analysis on specific variables,

```python
# perform correlation analysis on Q and O variables
d_corr = d[['Q', 'O']].corr()

# print pairwise correlation matrix
print(d_corr)

 	Q 	O
Q 	1.000000 	0.762706
O 	0.762706 	1.000000

plt.scatter(d['Q'], d['O'])
plt.text(x=-7.5, y=10, s='R=0.76')
plt.xlabel("Q")
plt.ylabel("O")
plt.show()
# optional: to save high quality figure to a file
plt.savefig('qo.png', format='png', bbox_inches='tight', dpi=300)

```

Generated correlation plot by above code,
