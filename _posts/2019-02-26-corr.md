**<span style="color:#33a8ff">What is Correlation?</span>**
- Correlation used to identify the association between variables
- Correlation of two variables (pairwise) has values between -1 (negative correlation) and 1 (positive correlation)
- Statistical tests to measure correlation: Pearson, Spearman rank, Kendall Tau
- In bioinformatics, correlation can be used to identify coregulated gene expression, check quality of biological 
  replicates etc.

**<span style="color:#33a8ff">Calculating correlation in Python</span>** 

Sample dataset used in this tutorial [dataset]({{"/myfiles/corr/corr_dataset.csv" | absolute_url }}) to calculate 
correlation between variables. This sample gene expression dataset contains 13324 genes and 18 variables (A to R). 
These variables represent the log2 expression fold changes between different treatments.

```python
# We will use `bioinfokit` for correlation analysis
# download and install bioinfokit (Tested on Linux, Mac, Windows) 
# Read documentation at https://github.com/reneshbedre/bioinfokit
git clone https://github.com/reneshbedre/bioinfokit.git
cd bioinfokit
python3 setup.py install
```

```python
# you can use interactive python console, jupyter or python code
# I am using interactive python console (Python 3.6)
# Read documentation at https://github.com/reneshbedre/bioinfokit
>>>from bioinfokit import visuz
>>>import pandas as pd
# load data file
>>>d = pd.read_csv("https://reneshbedre.github.io/myfiles/corr/corr_dataset.csv")
# delete identifier column
>>>d = d.drop("geneid", 1)
# correlation analysis plot
>>>visuz.corr_mat(table=d)
# plot will be saved in same directory (corr_mat.png)

```

Generated correlation plot by above code (red: positive correlation and blue: negative correlation),

<!--
To perform correlation analysis on specific variables,

```python
# perform correlation analysis on Q and O variables
d_corr = d[['Q', 'O']].corr()

# print pairwise correlation matrix
print(d_corr)

 	Q 	O
Q 	1.000000 	0.762706
O 	0.762706 	1.000000

plt.scatter(d['Q'], d['O'])
plt.text(x=-7.5, y=10, s='R=0.76')
plt.xlabel("Q")
plt.ylabel("O")
plt.show()
# optional: to save high quality figure to a file
plt.savefig('qo.png', format='png', bbox_inches='tight', dpi=300)

```

Generated correlation plot by above code,
